# Changelog

This project follows Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed
- Complete visual redesign of navigation, workspace canvas, cards, metrics, release lists, forms, settings, authentication and loading states.
- Reduced wasted horizontal and vertical space so more useful content appears at once.
- Introduced a punchier dark art direction with acid-lime and electric-cyan highlights, asymmetrical card silhouettes, graphic accent bars and stronger hierarchy.
- Added page-entry motion, animated section accents, floating empty states, hover feedback and tactile button transitions.
- Restyled existing appearance customisation controls to complement the new interface.

### Accessibility and compatibility
- Retained responsive mobile navigation and compact mobile layouts.
- Preserved reduced-motion support.
- Kept Supabase integration and feature logic unchanged.
- Bumped asset query versions and service-worker cache namespace to avoid stale assets.

### Verification
- CSS brace-balance check passed before commit.
- Live visual, browser-console, authenticated Supabase and cross-device regression testing remains outstanding.
